Time Limit: 3.0 second

Memory Limit: 64 MB

During his recent trip to the center of the Zone, stalker Shtyr got into an
earlier unknown anomaly. Things looked black — he started growing fangs and his
eyes turned red. Now only the Swamp Doctor can save Shtyr from turning into a
vampire… Shtyr does not know the Doctor's email address but suggests that the
address is stored in the pocket PC of the dead stalker Semetsky, which Shtyr has
found recently. But the problem is that the shrewd Semetsky didn't use an
address book but hid all the addresses in the contents of a big text file.
Though Shtyr can read this file, he doesn't know which segment of the file is
the Doctor's address.  Shtyr wants to find all segments of the text that can be
addresses and send an email to each of them. How many emails will he send?  An
email address in the vicinity of the Zone consists of a username and domain
separated by the “@” symbol. The username and domain are nonempty strings
consisting of lowercase English letters and dots. They cannot start or end with
a dot and cannot contain two consecutive dots.  Input You are given the contents
of the file from Semetsky's pocket PC. The file contains only symbols with ASCII
codes from 32 to 126 and line breaks. The total size of the file is at most 10^6
bytes.

Output Output the number of different email addresses in Semetsky's file.

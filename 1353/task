1353. Milliard Vasya's Function
Time Limit: 1.0 second
Memory Limit: 16 MB
Vasya is the beginning mathematician. He decided to make an important
contribution to the science and to become famous all over the world. But how
can he do that if the most interesting facts such as Pythagor’s theorem are
already proved? Correct!  He is to think out something his own, original. So he
thought out the Theory of Vasya’s Functions. Vasya’s Functions (VF) are rather
simple: the value of the Nth VF in the point S is an amount of integers from 1
to N that have the sum of digits S. You seem to be great programmers, so Vasya
gave you a task to find the milliard VF value (i.e. the VF with N = 109)
because Vasya himself won’t cope with the task. Can you solve the problem?
Input
Integer S (1 ≤ S ≤ 81).
Output
The milliard VF value in the point S.
